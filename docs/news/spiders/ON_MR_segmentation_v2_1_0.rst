ON_MR_segmentation_v2_1_0
=========================

* **What does it do?**
More flexible version of ON_MR_segmentation which utilizes an atlas definition file to allow for multiple atlases to be used to segment a single project. Each scan type is assigned an atlas directory which is used for multi-atlas segmentation on a cropped region. Cropping is done through a rigid multi-atlas segmentation of the eye globes and padding. 

v2.1 update allows for rerunning of assessors without repeating registrations. The spider checks for the NON_RIGID_REGISTRATION and CROPPED_TARGETS resources and if they are available, uses them. The process will rewarp all of the atlas labels. This is useful for rerunning segmentations with new label sets. Note that a full rerun is possible by deleting all current resources and restarting the process.
