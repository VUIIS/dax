Multi_Atlas_ADNI
================

* **What does it do?**
Runs the standard Multi_Atlas pipeline on a custom designed assessor. The assessor takes and averaged
volume and runs the pipline on it rather than a single file. This is a highly customized pipeline. Use with caution.
You should most likely not need to run this but rather use Multi_Atlas or Multi_Atlas_v2_0_0.
